    """Python3 interface implementation.

    Python3 provides a class that can be used as a context manager, which
    creates a temporary directory and removes it when the context manager
    exits. This function emulates enough of the interface of
    TemporaryDirectory, for this module to use, and is designed as a drop in
    replacement that can be replaced after the python3 port.

    The only user visible difference is that this does not implement the
    cleanup method that TemporaryDirectory does.
