Config options
==============

The following lists all available config options with their type and default values.
The type of an option is used to validate a given value. For instance,
if the type says "boolean" you may only provide "True" or "False" as values in your config file,
otherwise alot will complain on startup. Strings *may* be quoted but do not need to be.
